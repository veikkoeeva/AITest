# AI .NET Project

A test project to explore and develop an end-to-end AI project. The basic assumption is that an AI system can be implemented using good software engineering practices and a flexible architecture, rather than relying on "a system that encompasses it all." The project includes testing agentic ideas, with the majority of the code written in .NET.

## Goals and Objectives

- [ ] **Selecting models** suitable for deploying to the edge (web and mobile) for some yet-to-be-defined tasks. For instance, exploring quantizing model weights to 8 bytes, ensuring the model is appropriately sized and fit for the task.

- [ ] Training, fine-tuning, RAG, CAG. See also e.g. [Vision RAG](https://github.com/Softlandia-Ltd/vision-is-all-you-need).

- [ ] **Multi-language considerations** Consider a case of interaction in multiple languages.

- [ ] **Safety, security and trace** Circuit breakers, tracing and proper Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA).
  
- [ ] **Testing a vector database** for edge clients.

- [ ] **Server-side components** that work with edge clients, such as:
  - Postgres with vector extensions.
  - DuckDB with graph extensions.
  - Integrating AI on the edge with server-side AI.

- [ ] **Incorporating Geographic Information Systems (GIS):** Raster data and other geospatial considerations.

- [ ] **Building a knowledge graph** on top of a database property graph.

- [ ] **Exploring temporal graphs.**

- [ ] **Time-series.**

- [ ] **Anomaly detection.**

- [ ] **Implementing quality control** for AI inputs, enabling comparison of results against both old and new models.

- [ ] **Exploring distributed systems** with potential frameworks/tools.

- [ ] **Testing Bayesian reasoning** using [Infer.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/infer).

- [ ] **Developing and exploring** using tools like Jupyter Notebooks or equivalent.

- [ ] **Evaluating ready AI services** available on:
  - Azure.
  - Cloudflare.
  - [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/what-is-ai-studio).

## Progress

This README will be updated as tasks are completed and new goals are defined.
